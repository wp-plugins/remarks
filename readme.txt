Graph and charts breakdown of comments by post author and category.

== Description ==

Hi, and thanks for trying Remarks! We hope that this gives you a useful visual breakdown of the comments that your site has acquired, and maybe even help you to decide how to focus your blog for even greater comment harvesting.

First props have to go to the genius behind libchart http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/. I'll be honest, I have made some minor cosmetic changes to his code, to make colours consistent and to remove some things that weren't desired for our purpose. 

Here at Frag1 we currently plan to employ line graphs to show you how the number of comments you've gained has increased overtime. That's still WIP, but we will release it as soon as we can. For now pie charts and bar graphs will have to do.

Enjoy! Oh, and *all* feedback is really appreciated - please mail to john@frag1.co.uk

== Installation ==

1. Upload remarks.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip remarks.zip (so that all the contents are in `/wp-content/plugins/remarks`)
