Graph, charts, geolocations, and lists of comments by post author and category.

== Description ==

Remarks gives a useful visual breakdown of the comments that your blog has acquired, and may help you to decide how to focus your blog for even greater comment harvesting. The breakdown that Remarks produces is accessible via the WordPress Admin menu.

Hi, thanks for examining Remarks! First props have to go to the genius behind libchart http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/. I'll be honest, I have made some minor cosmetic changes to his code, to make colours consistent and to remove some things that weren't desired for our purpose. 

Here at Frag1 we currently plan to employ line graphs to show you how the number of comments you've gained has increased overtime. That's still WIP, but we will release it as soon as we can. For now pie charts and bar graphs will have to do.

Enjoy! Oh, and *all* feedback is really appreciated - please mail to john HAT frag1.co DOT uk.

Intended Future Developments:

1. Different pages for each breakdown by Author or Category.
2. Line charts to show the number of posts over time.
3. A globe showing the location of the majority of your commenters (based on their IP!)
