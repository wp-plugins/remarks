Analysis of your site's comments, showing which posts, authors, and categories generate the most discussion with tables, charts and geolocation.

== Description ==

Remarks gives useful charts, tables, and geolocations of your blog's comments, and may help you to decide how to focus your blog for even greater comment harvesting.  You will be able to see which of your posts, categories, and authors generate the most discussion. The breakdowns that Remarks produces are accessible via the WordPress Admin menu.

Remarks uses a slightly modified library called LibChart (http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/) to draw bar and pie charts.
